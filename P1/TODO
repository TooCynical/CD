- Parser: Check whether all lines contain three integers 
    (see all_one_line edgecase).
- LowerBound: Implement GetLowerBound / SetUseBBLowerBound / 
    SetUseOneTreeLowerBound. (done)
- Add Prune to solver after popping heap. (done)
- Update Merge to check whether to loop or list labels.
- Currently the fact that labels are stored in Vertex objects breaks
    depencies / is not nice. Maybe introduce some VertexWrapper and store
    those in Solver.
- Optimize OneTreeLowerBound and MST.
- Cleanup Solver.
